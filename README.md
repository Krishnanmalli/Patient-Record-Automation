# Automation-Testing-of-Patient-Record-Management-System

# Overview 
After completing my automation testing course, I worked on automating 
test cases for a demo Patient Record Management System using Selenium WebDriver 
and Java. Developed test scripts to automate key functionality such as patient 
account creation, vital record entry and record retrieval.

# Tools Used 
Selenium Webdriver, TestNG (for test execution) 

# Description 
* Maintained and developed Selenium Webdriver scripts for functional testing.
* Run test cases to ensure basic functionalities such as patient account creation, 
  vital record entry and record retrieval.
* Automated test execution using TestNG for structured testing and reporting.
* Conducted cross-browser testing to achieve uniform application behavior.
* Reviewed test scripts to improve efficiency and maintainability.
